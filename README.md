## Explanation of Data:

**Altitude (ft)**: The altitude of the aircraft.\
**Heading (deg)**: Compass direction of the aircraft.\
**CAS (kt)**: Flight speed regulated by altitude.\
**Ground speed (kt)**: The speed of the aircraft relative to the ground.\
**Mach**: The ratio of the speed of the aircraft to the speed of sound.\
**Temp (C)**: Outdoor temperature.\
**APU Fuel**: A system used when the plane is on the ground.\
**Mass**: Mass of aircraft.\
**FF1 (lb/hr)**: Instantaneous fuel consumption of the first engine (lbs per hour).\
